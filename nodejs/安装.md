Install script
To install or update nvm, you can use the install script using cURL:

# 用nvm 安装nodejs

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
```

or Wget:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash
```

The script clones the nvm repository to ~/.nvm and adds the source line to your profile (~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or ~/.bashrc).

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

You can customize the install source, directory, profile, and version using the NVM_SOURCE, NVM_DIR, PROFILE, and NODE_VERSION variables. Eg: curl ... | NVM_DIR=/usr/local/nvm bash for a global install. Ensure that the NVM_DIR does not contain a trailing slash.

NB. The installer can use git, curl, or wget to download nvm, whatever is available.

Note: On Linux, after running the install script, if you get nvm: command not found or see no feedback from your terminal after you type:

```bash
command -v nvm
```
